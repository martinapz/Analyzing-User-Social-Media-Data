Week 1 (Nov 8 - Nov 14)
- This week we worked on creating the graph.cpp/.h classes which will format the data being
  inputed into the correct format.

Week 2 (Nov 15 - Nov 21)
- This week we worked on the readFile method which takes in our data, then reads it in with 
  the graph class we created in week 1.

Week 3 (Nov 22 - Nov 28)
- This week we finished implementing the shorestPath method using Dijkstra's algorithm. We 
  also implemented the test cases for helper functions of the method. We also added some
  more functionalities to graph.cpp in order to have indecies of Nodes to help us keep 
  track of the Nodes.

Week 4 (Nov 29 - Dec 5)
- This week we implemented the BFS algorithm. We also continued testing our shortest 
  path algorithm and helper functions in the algorithms.cpp class. On the 4th, we also met
  with our TA to go over what we have already implemented and next steps for our project.

Week 5 (Dec 6 - Dec 12)
- This week we implemented the Floyd Warshall and Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
  We worked on test cases for both using differently sized test files including a new test
  file that has 10+ nodes. We added some more tests for our previously defined methods using
  the bigger test file.
- We updated the ReadMe file, and printed the results of our algorithms in the main function,
  reading in our largest data set. 
- We created our presentation with our final findings and implementation details. We have also 
  created our presentation video using powerwpoint slide.
